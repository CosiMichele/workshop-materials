# KEYS Computational Proficiency Assessment 

Welcome to the Computing Skills Assessment. Over the past few weeks, you were asked to complete the following Software Carpentries modules:

- [Shell (also referred to as Command Line or CLI)](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
- [Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/index.html)
- [R](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/)

This is **not a test** of how much you already know — it's a way for us to understand how you work with the basic tools of modern science computing:

You’ll complete **one small script** for each language. Each script should show that you've practiced the **core skills** introduced in the corresponding Carpentries lesson.

We want to see **your thinking and your style** — not a copy-paste answer or something fancy from ChatGPT.

---

## What You’ll Submit

Submit the following **3 scripts**:

| Language | Filename             | Format       |
|----------|----------------------|--------------|
| CLI      | `cli_task.sh`        | Bash script  |
| Python   | `python_task.py`     | Python script|
| R        | `r_task.R`           | R script     |

Each script should:
- Work when run from the terminal.
- Contain **only material found in the Carpentries lesson** for that language.
- Include **comments** explaining your thought process (`# why did you use this command?`).
- Be your own work

Each [Software Carpentry lesson](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/index.html) comes with its own data:
- [Shell/CLI](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) provides you with [`shell-lesson-data.zip`](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/data/shell-lesson-data.zip)
- Python is broken down into two parts:
  - [Programming with Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) provides:
    - [`python-novice-inflammation-data.zip`](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/data/python-novice-inflammation-data.zip)
    - [`python-novice-inflammation-code.zip`](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/files/code/python-novice-inflammation-code.zip)
  - [Plotting and programming with Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) provides:
    - [`python-novice-gapminder-data.zip`](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/files/python-novice-gapminder-data.zip)
- The R lesson is also comes in two parts:
  - [Programming with R](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/) provides:
    - [`r-novice-inflammation-data.zip`](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/data/r-novice-inflammation-data.zip)
  - [R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/) provides:
    - [`gapminder_data.csv`](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/data/gapminder_data.csv)

## Example Task Prompts

We will provide you with prompts like these. Each is small but meaningful:

- CLI:  
  > Write a script that lists all `.txt` files in a directory and saves the filenames to `txt_files.txt`.

- Python:  
  > Using only Gapminder data (provided), write a script that prints the average life expectancy for a given continent.

- R:  
  > Read in a CSV, calculate the mean of one column, and plot a simple graph using base R.

We'll provide input data when needed. Don’t worry about doing something huge — we want clear, correct, and thoughtful code.

## How It Will Be Assessed

Each script will be reviewed using this rubric:

| Criteria                        | Points |
|---------------------------------|--------|
| Uses only material from lesson  | ✅     |
| Script runs without error       | ✅     |
| Output is correct               | ✅     |
| Code is commented/explained     | ✅     |
| Code shows original thinking    | ✅     |

We will **automatically test** your scripts, so please:
- **Name your files correctly**
- **Don’t hardcode file paths or absolute paths**
- **Keep it simple and clean**

## A Note on AI

We want to see how **you** think. Submitting code written by AI (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) **goes against the spirit of this assessment**.

This is about **building skill, not getting the answer** — and we’re looking forward to seeing your work!

## How to Submit

Please upload your 3 script files in a `.zip` folder named:
