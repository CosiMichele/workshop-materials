# 2025 AI in Biosciences

The focus on this series is to bring attention to how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is affecting and contributing the world of Bioinformatics.

This is **not** a workshop series that will teach the nuances of AI, but instead how each one of us can use current AI technologies to improve productivity surrounding the field.

Each session will cover at least one AI-related tool and no fees are associated with the workshop series or the tools covered.

The series spans 5 sessions:

| Date | Session Title | Session Content | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| 09/04 | AI as Your Research Assistant | Learn how to use publicly available AI as your research assistant: brainstorming an experiment, furthering your hypotheses, aiding with literature reviews, identifying potential insights, and helping with code and computation. This session will focus on using ChatGPT (or your favourite AI) as writing partners and productivity aids — no programming required. You’ll leave with practical prompt templates and strategies to save time and communicate more clearly. |
| 09/11 | How AI Sees Biological Data | This session introduces you to how AI models process biological data like images, protein structures, and sequences. We will discuss tools such as AlphaFold for structure prediction, Cellpose for cell segmentation,  DeepLabCut for motion tracking, and DeepVariant for sequence alignments. |
| 09/18 | Applying Language Models for Biological Research | This session focuses on using AI language models to understand and process scientific language — from parsing papers and protocols to generating PubMed queries or cleaning metadata. You'll learn how to use AI to extract insights from documents and automate literature searches. |
| 09/25 | Debugging, Optimizing, and Translating Code With AI | Learn how to use AI to troubleshoot bioinformatics workflows, translate between R, Python, and Bash, and refactor scripts for clarity and reproducibility. Whether it's fixing a broken Nextflow command or understanding a confusing error, AI can help. Bring your own examples or use ours — this session is built on real-world frustrations. | 
| 10/02 | Using AI to Interpret Analyses and Results | You’ve run the pipeline — now what? This session focuses on showing how AI can be used in order to make sense of the data, figures or reports you have generated, and asking the correct questions to follow up the results. |
