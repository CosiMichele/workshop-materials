## Overview

"While AI represents rapid scientific advances, its integration must align with open science principles to ensure replicability, credibility, equity and trustworthiness. Open science offers mutual benefits for AI by expanding participation in research and promoting inclusive practices. The open science approach, when combined with AI technologies, can significantly contribute to addressing the current pressing global threats." - [Blurb of UNESCO event "Navigating the Intersection of Open Science and AI: Exploring Opportunities and Challenges in the Era of Artificial Intelligence"](https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/exploring-opportunities-and-challenges-intersection-open-science-and-artificial-intelligence), held in June 2024.

All eyes of the world are pointed towards the new shiny object in the room: Artificial Intelligence. A fundamentally beautiful technology that is shaking the world of science (and education, economics, politics and jurisdiction amongst others) from the inside out.

Open Science is being heavily impacted, in aspects that we are gonig to be discussing today. As AI is a field that is currently seeing exponenital growth, we focus on questions, topics and aspects that AI/ML plays a role in:

- [The role of AI in Open Science](#the-role-of-ai-in-open-science)
  - [Overview](#overview)
  - [The Role of AI in Automated Research and Discovery](#the-role-of-ai-in-automated-research-and-discovery)
  - [AI’s Impact on Research Accessibility and Collaboration](#ais-impact-on-research-accessibility-and-collaboration)
  - [The Ethics of AI-Generated Scientific Knowledge](#the-ethics-of-ai-generated-scientific-knowledge)


Today's workshop will be carried out in a discussion fashion, with experts in the field sharing their knowledge on how AI is impacting Open Science.
