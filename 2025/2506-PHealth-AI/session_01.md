# Creating Reproducible Analysis Workflows

## The Importance of Reproducibility

The most important thing in science are knowledge, intelligence and the ability to inquire in order to push the field of knowledge forward.

One of the biggest problems to challenge science, is the ability to recall or recreate a certain experiment, regardless of field.

Therefore, **reproducibility** becomes key, as it allows colleagues and scientists around the world to recreate the science you have achieved. Most importantly, reproducibility helps ***YOU*** recall the experiments you carried out yesterday.

Reproducibility requires diligence, attention and committment. As shown in the graph above, there is a spectrum to Reproducibility. One should *try* to produce a well Reproducible work, but not always it is *necessary* to be on the right side of the spectrum (those are the "unicorn" papers!). Where do you stand on the Reproducibility spectrum?
