## The Importance of Reproducibility

The most important thing in science are knowledge, intelligence and the ability to inquire in order to push the field of knowledge forward.

One of the biggest problems to challenge science, is the ability to recall or recreate a certain experiment, regardless of field.

Therefore, **reproducibility** becomes key, as it allows colleagues and scientists around the world to recreate the science you have achieved. Most importantly, reproducibility helps ***YOU*** recall the experiments you carried out yesterday.
