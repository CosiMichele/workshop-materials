## Deep Learning in Bioinformatics

Modern biology heavily relies on data from advanced techniques. For precision medicine to be effective, we need to properly analyze this data. [Tools from bioinformatics and artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning_in_bioinformatics) are essential in transforming big data into actionable information.

* [Information science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_science) focuses on how to collect, organize, and share information, covering areas like [library science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_and_information_science) and [data management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_management), with uses in education and business.
* [Artificial intelligence (AI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) mimics human thinking in machines, performing tasks like [speech recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition) and [decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making), and is widely used in healthcare and self-driving cars.
* [Machine learning (ML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), a part of AI, helps computers learn from data to make predictions without direct programming, applied in areas like [protein structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_structure) and [disease diagnosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis).
* [Deep learning (DL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning), a type of ML, uses [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network) to process data in layers, greatly improving AI's ability to perform tasks like [image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision) and [speech recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition) with high accuracy.

[Machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), a branch of artificial intelligence, develops algorithms that learn from data to make predictions or decisions. It's widely applied in fields like image recognition, natural language processing, autonomous vehicles, and medical diagnosis ([Acosta et al., 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11045206/#b2-tjb-47-06-366)).

Machine learning algorithms require numeric data, typically represented as matrices of samples and features. When data isn't numeric, feature engineering transforms it into usable numeric features ([Roe et al., 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11045206/#b74-tjb-47-06-366)).

High-quality, accurate, and representative data is crucial for machine learning algorithms to learn correct patterns and make accurate predictions ([Habehh and Gohel, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11045206/#b36-tjb-47-06-366)). Expert-crafted features, designed by domain specialists, can enhance algorithm performance, especially with limited training data ([Lin et al., 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11045206/#b57-tjb-47-06-366)).

Common machine learning algorithms include ([Hastie et al., 2009](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11045206/#b37-tjb-47-06-366); [Jovel and Greiner, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11045206/#b42-tjb-47-06-366)):

- [Linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression): Finds best-fit lines for variable relationships
- [Logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression): Predicts event probabilities
- [Decision trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning): Uses binary decisions for predictions
- [Random forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest): Combines multiple decision trees
- [Support vector machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine): Finds optimal separating hyperplanes
- [Neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network_(machine_learning)): Uses interconnected nodes to learn complex patterns

In summary, machine learning is a versatile tool requiring numeric, high-quality data and sometimes expert-crafted features. Various algorithms are available to address different problems.

Neural networks, introduced decades ago, have evolved from simple structures to deep neural networks with multiple layers. Modern deep learning models typically consist of input, hidden, and output layers, leveraging increased computational power to handle more complex architectures.

The input layer receives raw data or features, with each node representing a data point. Hidden layers transform this data into abstract representations, with multiple layers defining the "depth" of the network. The output layer produces the final prediction based on the processed information.

Deep learning models are trained by adjusting connection weights to minimize errors, often using large labeled datasets and optimization techniques like backpropagation and gradient descent. Model architecture is typically chosen empirically for each specific task.

Unlike traditional machine learning, deep learning automatically detects higher-level features. This can lead to reduced explainability, which is particularly important in fields like healthcare where understanding decision-making processes is crucial ([Sarker, 2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11045206/#b78-tjb-47-06-366); [the Precise4Q consortium et al., 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11045206/#b90-tjb-47-06-366)).

## Real World Applications

We live surrounded by data. Big or small. Large or minimal. Through the power of statistics, we have learned to leverage this data to give us further insights in the data that the world around us is full of.

ML/AI has accented this data discovery, but it comes with a couple of caveats:

1. ML/AI is difficult to learn (but is becoming more and more accessible!) and apply
2. ML/AI requires **a lot** of resources in order to execute: platforms require large GPU clusters and disk space; Models require a massive amount of power to be created.

Here are a few examples of groups that were able to take this technology and give us a window on the potential applications of ML/AI in Bioinformatics.

### [Machine learning algorithms to infer trait-matching and predict species interactions in ecological networks](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/machine-learning-algorithms-to-infer-trait)

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8d221383-9cc3-4f63-a6c9-0a760e368e11/mee313329-fig-0003-m.jpg" width="600">
</p>

This paper investigates the use of machine learning algorithms to infer trait-matching and predict species interactions in ecological networks. 

Specifically, the authors compare the performance of various machine learning models, including** random forests**, **boosted regression trees**, **deep neural networks**, and **support vector machines**, with traditional generalized linear models (GLMs) in predicting plant-pollinator interactions based on species traits. 

The study finds that the best machine learning models outperform GLMs in both prediction accuracy and identification of the causal trait-trait combinations responsible for interactions. 

 The study compares the performance of seven ML models:

- Random Forest (RF)
- Boosted Regression Trees (BRT)
- Deep Neural Networks (DNN)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- NaÃ¯ve Bayes
- k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)

This advantage stems from ML models' ability to:

- **Capture Complex Trait-Matching Structures**: ML models effectively detect and utilize complex interactions between traits (trait-trait interactions), a capability where GLMs often fall short. This flexibility is crucial because trait matching in real-world ecosystems can be intricate, involving multiple traits and non-linear relationships.
- **Address Overfitting**: ML models are inherently designed to mitigate overfitting, a common issue when dealing with a large number of possible trait-trait interactions. This robustness allows them to generalize better and provide more accurate predictions, especially when the number of potential trait combinations is high.
- **Handle Uneven Species Distributions**: ML models can effectively account for the fact that some species are more abundant than others, thereby preventing biases in predictions. This is crucial because species abundance significantly influences the number of observed interactions and can confound the trait-matching signal.
- **Accommodate Different Data Types and Observation Time**s: The study indicates that ML models can effectively work with both presence-absence data and interaction frequency data, providing flexibility in applying the approach to various ecological datasets. Moreover, they can handle data with imbalanced class distributions, which is common in ecological networks with limited observation times.

The study also highlights the ability of ML models, coupled with the H-statistic, to identify the specific trait-trait combinations that drive species interactions (trait matching) with high accuracy. This capability is critical for:

- **Understanding Ecological Mechanisms**: Identifying the specific traits responsible for interactions provides insights into the ecological mechanisms underlying network formation and the functional basis of species interactions.
- **Predicting Ecosystem Responses to Change**: Understanding trait matching helps predict how species interactions might change in response to environmental shifts, such as climate change or species introductions. This information is vital for conservation efforts and managing ecosystem services.
- **Moving Beyond Phylogenetic Proxies**: While previous studies often relied on phylogenetic information as a proxy for unobserved traits, ML models can focus on directly measurable functional traits, leading to more interpretable and ecologically relevant insights.


The authors emphasize the potential of machine learning for advancing our understanding of species interactions and ecological networks, beyond standard tasks like image or pattern recognition.

### [RNA-seq assistant: machine learning based methods to identify more transcriptional regulated genes](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12864-018-4932-2)

This paper proposes a machine learning method for identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in RNA sequencing data. 

By using epigenomic data from histone modifications such as acetylation, the model learns the association of these markers with gene expression and uses this to predict DEGs. The authors found that the model using InfoGain feature selection and Logistic Regression classification was most effective for identifying DEGs in the response to ethylene, and validated the prediction results through qRT-PCR. 

Their research suggests that combining epigenomic information with RNA-seq data analysis using machine learning methods could significantly improve the sensitivity of DEG identification.

This scientific research article examines the use of machine learning (ML) models to predict glaucoma-related traits from color fundus photographs. 

The authors developed an ML model that accurately predicts the vertical cup-to-disc ratio (VCDR) and identified 299 independent genome-wide significant hits in 156 loci associated with VCDR, replicating known loci and discovering 92 novel ones. 

They also found that the model improved polygenic risk scores for VCDR and primary open-angle glaucoma, demonstrating the potential for ML-based phenotyping to enhance large-scale genetic studies of complex diseases.
